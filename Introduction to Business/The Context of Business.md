### Addressing Market Needs
#### Key Points
- A market is one of many varieties of systems, institutions, procedures, social relations, and infrastructures whereby parties engage in exchange.
- Many companies today have a customer focus (or market orientation). This implies that the company focuses its activities and products on consumer demands.
- Market research is for discovering what people want, need, and believe; and how they behave.
- Market segmentation is the division of the market or population into subgroups with similar motivations.
#### What is Market
1. In mainstream economics, the concept of a **market** is any structure that allows buyers and sellers to exchange any type of goods, services, and information. The exchange of goods or services for money is called a **transaction**. Market participants consist of all the buyers and sellers of a certain good, thus influencing its price.
2. A firm in the market economy survives by producing goods that persons are willing and able to buy. Consequently, ascertaining market needs is vital for a firm's future viability, and even existence, as a going concern.

### Profit and Value
#### Key Points
- Normal profit represents the total opportunity costs (both explicit and implicit) of a venture to an investor, whereas economic profit is the difference between a firm's total revenue and all costs (including normal profit).
- Given that profit is defined as the difference in total revenue and total cost, a firm achieves a maximum profit by operating at the point where the difference between the two is at its greatest.
- The value of a firm is linked to profit maximization. A firm looking to maximize its profits is actually concerned with maximizing its value.

### Profit and StackHolders
#### Key Points
- The stockholders are the owners of the company, and the firm has a binding fiduciary duty to put their needs first to increase value for them.
- Stakeholder theory argues that there are other parties involved, including governmental bodies, political groups, trade associations, trade unions, communities, associated corporations, prospective employees, prospective customers, and the public at large.
- In some scenarios, even competitors are included as stakeholders.
- Stakeholders believe that an organization should strive to achieve satisfaction among all parties involved, as opposed to solely pursuing the highest profit.
- In some scenarios, even competitors are included as stakeholders.
