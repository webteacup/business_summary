### Addressing Market Needs

#### Key Points

- A market is one of many varieties of systems, institutions, procedures, social relations, and infrastructures whereby parties engage in exchange.
- Many companies today have a customer focus (or market orientation). This implies that the company focuses its activities and products on consumer demands.
- Market research is for discovering what people want, need, and believe; and how they behave.
- Market segmentation is the division of the market or population into subgroups with similar motivations.

#### What is Market

1. In mainstream economics, the concept of a **market** is any structure that allows buyers and sellers to exchange any type of goods, services, and information. The exchange of goods or services for money is called a **transaction**. Market participants consist of all the buyers and sellers of a certain good, thus influencing its price.
2. A firm in the market economy survives by producing goods that persons are willing and able to buy. Consequently, ascertaining market needs is vital for a firm's future viability, and even existence, as a going concern.

### Profit and Value

#### Key Points

- Normal profit represents the total opportunity costs (both explicit and implicit) of a venture to an investor, whereas economic profit is the difference between a firm's total revenue and all costs (including normal profit).
- Given that profit is defined as the difference in total revenue and total cost, a firm achieves a maximum profit by operating at the point where the difference between the two is at its greatest.
- The value of a firm is linked to profit maximization. A firm looking to maximize its profits is actually concerned with maximizing its value.

### Profit and StackHolders

#### Key Points

- The stockholders are the owners of the company, and the firm has a binding fiduciary duty to put their needs first to increase value for them.
- Stakeholder theory argues that there are other parties involved, including governmental bodies, political groups, trade associations, trade unions, communities, associated corporations, prospective employees, prospective customers, and the public at large.
- In some scenarios, even competitors are included as stakeholders.
- Stakeholders believe that an organization should strive to achieve satisfaction among all parties involved, as opposed to solely pursuing the highest profit.
- In some scenarios, even competitors are included as stakeholders.

## Getting Down to Business

### Functional Areas of Business
- Managers are responsible for the work performance of other people. **Management** involves planning for, organizing, staffing, directing, and controlling a company's resources so that it can achieve its golas. Managers plan by setting golas and developing strategies for achieving them. They organize activities and resources to ensure that company goals are met. They *staff* the organization with qualified employees and *direct* them to accomplish organizational goals. Finally, managers design *controls* for assessing the success of plans and decisions and take corrective action when needed.
- All companies must convert resources (labour, materials, money, information, and so forth) into goods or services. Some companies, such as Apple, convert resources into tangible products- Macs, iPhones, iPods, iPads. Others, such as hospitals, convert resources into intangible products-health care. The person who designs and oversees the transformation of resources into goods or services is called an operations manager. This individual is also responsible for ensureing that products are of high quality
