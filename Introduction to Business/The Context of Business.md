### Addressing Market Needs

#### Key Points
- A market is one of many varieties of systems, institutions, procedures, social relations, and infrastructures whereby parties engage in exchange.
- Many companies today have a customer focus (or market orientation). This implies that the company focuses its activities and products on consumer demands.
- Market research is for discovering what people want, need, and believe; and how they behave.
- Market segmentation is the division of the market or population into subgroups with similar motivations.

#### What is Market
1. In mainstream economics, the concept of a **market** is any structure that allows buyers and sellers to exchange any type of goods, services, and information. The exchange of goods or services for money is called a **transaction**. Market participants consist of all the buyers and sellers of a certain good, thus influencing its price.

2. A firm in the market economy survives by producing goods that persons are willing and able to buy. Consequently, ascertaining market needs is vital for a firm's future viability, and even existence, as a going concern.
